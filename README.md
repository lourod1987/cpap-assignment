# TechAgg App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0b45c2de-353e-4e67-bda5-e4af2b05dc7c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/techagg/deploys)

This application displays technology news articles fetched from the Engadget API. Articles are searchable and current user data, whether an article has been viewed or visited on Engadget is tracked. 
Most of the application data is managed using Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some of Create-React-App's README information that is useful to running this project can be found below.

# Run the application
1. To retrieve the files you can clone the repository from this page.
* If you are downloading the files, unzip them, and extract the files to where you want them in your directory.
2. CD into the directory where the root folder of the application is and run 'yarn install' or 'npm install' in your terminal or cmd line.
3. Now run 'yarn start' or 'npm start' to run a live version of the application in development mode.
    This will automatically open a new window in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
* Alternatively you can visit the live link to this app [here](https://techagg.netlify.com/).


## Dependencies

This Web application was built with React, React Router, Redux, and SCSS. All required dependencies can be found in the package.json.

*Note*: Project initially used **yarn** to manage packages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
